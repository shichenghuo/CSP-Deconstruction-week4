#### Project 1: Computational Design by Kate Revyakina - https://vimeo.com/55500779
---
*Data* | *Render* | *Simulation* | *Event*
------------|------------|------------|------------
Shapes| The organic shapes moving smoothly on the canvas |Some shapes disappears at some point| Can be shape changes when users click mouse 
Colors| | Auto re-organized|
Sound|  |Color changes
Position of shapes(x,y)| |Generate new group of shapes
Movement direaction and lengths| 

#### Observation
This is a digital motion work. The shapes moves loosly and smoothly and it can re-organized or disappears.
